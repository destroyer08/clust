Cluster Analysis is an app which gives you feature of clustering on the basis of user's ratings or reviews. This app uses K-means 
clustering algorithm to make clusters. For visualization I have used many catchy plots available in R.
Along with to see clusters and their statistics this app also gives you principal component analysis. Scope of each product is
shown in scope chart by principal components with highest accuracy.
